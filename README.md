# Hashtag-Trends-During-Covid19_Data-Visualization

As a part of coursework related to the subject 'Data Visualization' in Trinity College Dublin, this project aims to analyze the happenings/incidents taking place in US during this pandemic. Since there is a situation of lockdown everywhere, it becomes of great importance for the country officers at work and the general public sitting at home to be informed about the activities going in their city. By analyzing the volume and type of tweets an idea can be made about the type and intensity of situation in a particular area at particular time of the day.


## Graphs plotted

- Map showing cities with most tweets
- Horizontal bars to show most frequent hashtags used
- Heat map showing volume of tweets w.r.t states/cities at particular time
- Bar graph to show number of tweets in US w.r.t time
- Bar graph to show number of tweets in US w.r.t state
